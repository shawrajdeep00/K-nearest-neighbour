STEPS
1. SPLIT GIVEN DATA INTO
TRAINING AND VALIDATION DATA, max = 0, maxk = 0
2. for k in range(1,100,2)
	correct = 0
	total = len(val_data)
3.  for each point p in val_data
4.   find distances of p from train
  data
5.   sort the distances
6.   find k nearest neighbors
7.   determine predicted class
8.   compare with actual class
9.   if correct then correct+=1
10. accuracy = correct*100/total
11. if accuracy>max then max = accuracy and maxk = k
12.END
